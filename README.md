# Programming Portfolio

This portfolio serves to showcase my skills and professional experience.
The site itself is a lot prettier, so I'd recommend navigating to [code.bassi.li](code.bassi.li) instead of reading this README file.

## Personal Summary

Howdy! My name is Michael, and I'm a software developer. I've built software ranging from small benchmarking tools to large-scale automation pipelines.

- Over five years of Python experience, both personal and professional
- Dedicated, self-motivated programmer who routinely tries to exceed expectations
- An accomplished creator, having brought dozens of personal and professional projects to fruition

Regardless of the project, tech stack, or development process, I promise to do my best work. If that sounds good, shoot me an email!
